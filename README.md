# Combination Sum in Java

## Project Description

This Java project solves the Combination Sum problem, which finds all unique combinations of numbers in an array that sum to a target value. Each number in the array can be used multiple times in a combination.


## Problem Statement

Given an array of **unique integers** (`candidates`) and a **target sum**, return all unique combinations where the chosen numbers sum up to the target.

**Example:**

```java
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
```
